# WARNING: The next line is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks
# This line directly inserts the user input into the SQL query
cursor.execute('select * from employees where position="Manager" and salary>'+salary)  # NEVER do this +salary | Prone to SQL Injection
# cursorObj.execute('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name={}â€™.format(name))  # NEVER do this +salary | Prone to SQL Injection

# Consider:
# cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE position="Manager" AND salary>' + salary)
# Of the user inputs:
# 0; DROP TABLE employees
# The SQL query becomes
# SELECT * FROM employees WHERE position="Manager" AND salary>0; DROP TABLE employees;
# Selects all employees with the position "Manager" and a salary greater than 0.
# Deletes the entire employees table (DROP TABLE employees), causing data loss.
# Corrected Version to Avoid SQL Injection
# # Use parameterized query to safely insert user input
# cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE position=? AND salary>?', ("Manager", salary))
# By using placeholders (?), you ensure that user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command, thereby preventing SQL injection attacks.

# Fetch all results from the last executed query

# Iterate over and print all fetched rows
for row in all_rows:
