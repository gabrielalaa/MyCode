# MyCode â€“ First-Year Python Scripts

I created this repository to gather all the Python scripts I wrote when I first started learning Python. These scripts are organized into directories based on my journey:

- **First Semester** and **Second Semester**:  
  Code I wrote during my first year as an Informatics student at **IMC Krems University of Applied Sciences** under the guidance of *Prof. (FH). Dipl.-Ing. Dr. techn. Deepak Dhungana*.

- **Extra_code**:  
  Various exercises and experiments, including problems from **Advent of Code**, **GeeksForGeeks**, **HackerRank**, **Project Euler**, and **PYnative**. Some solutions are entirely my own, while others are a mix of my ideas and interesting tricks found online.

### No Requirements File?
I decided not to include a `requirements.txt` because:
- This repository primarily shows coding exercises and snippets rather than a single runnable application.
- Many scripts contain multiple solutions and are meant for reference rather than direct execution.
